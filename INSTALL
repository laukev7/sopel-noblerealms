NobleBot Howto
=====================

Requirements

Python 2.7
Pip (recommended to install modules, but easy_install can be used instead)
git (optional, but recommended in order to keep modules up to date)
lxml (optional; only supported under linux)
enchant (optional; only supported under linux)


Setting up prerequisites
========================


Windows
-------

Download and install Python 2.7 from http://www.python.org/download/

In your environment variables, append the following to your PATH variable:

C:\Python2.7\Scripts

To install Git, download it from http://git-scm.com/download/win and run the executable. Select "Run Git from the command prompt" when prompted.


The configuration files are located in C:\Users\UserName\.willie


Linux
-----

Use your distribution package installer to install module dependencies (e.g. lxml or enchant).

Python 2.7 and Git should be available via the package manager; if not, refer to the CentOS section.


The configuration files are located in the home directory, ie. ~/.willie or /home/username/.willie


CentOS
------

As of version 6.5, CentOS does not come with Python 2.7 by default, so this needs to be installed separately. Installation instructions can be found here:

https://github.com/0xdata/h2o/wiki/Installing-python-2.7-on-centos-6.3.-Follow-this-sequence-exactly-for-centos-machine-only

To install Python modules, make sure you are installing them with pip-2.7, or else they will be installed only for the default Python installation instead of the 2.7 one.

Use Yum to install Git or module dependencies (e.g. lxml or enchant)


The configuration files are located in the home directory, ie. ~/.willie or /home/username/.willie


Mac OS X (10.9 and later)
-------------------------

Python 2.7 is installed by default. To install pip, run:

easy_install pip

To install git, install the latest version of XCode (available in the App Store). 

Then install Homebrew with the following command:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

Then install Git with the following command:

brew install GIT


The configuration files are located in /Users/Username/.willie



Mac OS X (10.8 and earlier)
---------------------------

Python 2.7 can be installed with Homebrew with the following instructions:

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/

Then download the following file:

https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py

and run it with python 2.7:

	python2.7 ./get-pip.py


To install git, install the latest version of XCode supported by your OS. Then run the following:

	brew install GIT


The configuration files are located in /Users/Username/.willie



Setting up NobleBot
-------------------

1) run:
	pip install willie


2) run willie. This should be in your global path.

3) Press ctrl+C to quit Willie. You do not need to configure Willie since you will use a pre-set config file.

3) In the willie configuration root directory, create the directories 'modules' and 'noblerealms', if they do not already exist.

4) Create or overwrite default.cfg in the configuration root directory with the provided configuration file. The file contains the nickserv password for NobleBot, so contact the bot maintainer to obtain it.

5) Copy the willie.db file to the same directory (this may be updated arbitrarily, so contact the bot maintainer to obtain it).

6) Copy the modules from the willie-extras repository to the 'modules' directory, or run the following command:
	git clone https://github.com/embolalia/willie-extras.git

7) Copy the modules from the willie-noblerealms repository to the 'noblerealms' directory, or run the following command:
	git clone https://github.com/laukev7/willie-noblerealms.git

6) In default.cfg under [core], replace the 'extra' field with the absolute path of the directory where the custom willie-noblerealms modules will located ('noblerealms').

7) In default.cfg under [db], replace the userdb_file field with the absolute path of the willie.db file

8) Run the following command:

	pip install pytz requests feedparser tweepy python-dateutil praw lxml

9) Run willie. If any module fails to start, it will not prevent NobleBot from running. You may add the modules to the exclude field under [core] in the config file.


To start Willie
---------------

Run:
	willie -d


To stop willie
--------------

Run:

	willie --quit


To update modules
-----------------

1) cd to the directory containing the modules

2) run:

	git pull
